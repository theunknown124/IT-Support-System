# IT-Support-System

-Written in Java

Uses the Java Linked list collections framework

Look at the ITSupportSystemMain and ITSupportRequests java files.

The system itself ues the LinkedList queue interface of the collections framework to simulate a tech support queue
 
 The program can do:
 
 - Add an IT support ticket
 - Fix an IT support ticket (Essentially removing the object from the Linkedlist queue)
 - View the next IT support ticket
