# IT-Support-System

-Written in Java

Uses the Java Linked list collections framework

The system itself ues the LinkedList queue interface of the collections framework to simulate a tech support queue
 
 The program can do:
 
 - Add an IT support ticket
 - Fix an IT support ticket (Essentially removing the object from the Linkedlist queue)
 - View the next IT support ticket
